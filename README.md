science game 1
==============

So my ambition is to get better at programming, and what better way than creating a myriad of different, fun, science games for people to play. I've recently moved full time to my company, Science: Gamed, so it seems like the perfect opportunity to do this. Though my co-founder, the whiz kid Rich Harris, will still obviously be the lead developer for all our mobile games.

This is the git repository for my first game. Typically with these sorts of challenges, you set yourself an ambitious time limit and goal- eg: '60 games in 60 days'. I want to do this, but need to have a think about how this will work for the following reasons:

-typically people do this with website challenges (there was a well known one - 180 websites in 180 days [http://jenniferdewalt.com/]). But games, I contend, are slightly more complicated than websites and whilst you can build a website around 1 new bit of tech, it's harder to do that with games. 

-I want the games to actually be fun and inventive, not a bog standard game just to get it out in time. Deadlines tend to have pretty bad effects on games (in the wrong circumstances, although deadlines are, perhaps somewhat counter-intuitively, critical).

-I'm not completley free at the moment. My company is currently working on 'Monkey Panic', our first mobile game, and I have to make time for that (I am lead game designer and salesman). I want to complete a challenge but I don't want to set an ambitious target that will impact MP.

The above sounds like I'm worming out of making a committment, which I'd hate to be the impression you take away from this. So let's set the goal here, with the above in mind:

20 (good) games in 6 months. Each game needs at least 100 unique visitors/plays.

*Edit* I've had a re-think and decided to reduce the target total, by quite a bit actually. Based on how long this first one is taking me, Trying to do 100 games in 60 days would be pretty tough (unless I made some crap ones). So I've reduced the number, with the idea that each game will be of a certain standard also.

Boom. Done. See you on the other side.
