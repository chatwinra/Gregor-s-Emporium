Great! Thanks for helping. First up are peaplants. I have some customers who want specific types of peas. This physical trait is called a phenotype. Peaplants have two physical properties- round peas and wrinkled peas.
These phenotypes are caused by the genes in the peaplants- the genotypes. The question is- which gene combination causes which phenotype? I'm hoping you can help me here!
We know that genes are either dominant or recessive. A creature with a dominant gene will always express the phenotype that that gene causes.
A recessive trait will only be expressed if a creature has 2 recessive genes. Can you use this information to help me breed these peaplants correctly?
